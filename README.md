#### Notes:
- Weapon sway effect while on tripod may be set up at ((Settings -> Addon Options -> dzn Rifle Tripod))
- Any bipod items may be leveled using Alt+C keybind when "Enable anti-tilt for all bipods" option enabled
- You can whitelist bipods/weapons with integrated bipod using "Allow anti-tilt for" list option

- Mod uses ASDG_JointRails for compatibility (so it CUP/RHS/NIArms/etc. compatible)
- Mod is not compatible with weapons that lack underbarrel proxy and nothing can be done from my side
- There are few decorative tripod items available via console:
